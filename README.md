## Assignment:

Hotel Booking Website
A local tourism agency in Bergen is launching a new website called ‘Holidaze’ for visitors to the area to be able to find hotels, B&Bs and guesthouses, and for the accommodation owners to receive enquiries.

The project requires you to create the visitor side of the website where users can search accommodation and make enquiries, as well as the administration side where properties can be added and enquiries managed.

You will need to create an API to store the data for the establishments, enquiries and contact submissions. You can choose to use WordPress or Strapi as a Headless CMS, but it is very important that the API is deployed and publicly available. Please do not submit any files for your API. Only submit the website you have created.
